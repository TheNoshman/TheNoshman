### 👋 Hi there, I'm Chris

> *Shameless plug - [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisnorish/)*

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer primarily focused on the JavaScript environment. Proficient in React, React Native & Redux, Node.js, Express, Koa, Mongo, SQL, ORM's, GraphQL & WebSockets.

#### 🚀 Projects I'm currently working on:

☀️ [DaysAway](https://github.com/TheNoshman/DaysAway): A front end application coupled to a path-finding algorithm designed to offer the user a selection of potential days out. Enter a desired travel time/ departure location and the algorithm will return a swipable stack of destinations you can reach via public transport within the specified timeframe. The app also offers activities, journey details and weather at the destination.

#### 🤖 A bit about me:

When I'm not building the internet, I enjoy noodling on my guitar, tinkering with all kinds of mechanical engineering and exercising regularly to keep the blood pumping  to the melon.
